RNN RESULTS
Jay Dhanoa & Andy Ham (jdhanoa-aham)

For this part, we worked primarily with two versions of the RNN: one with four layers (which I've submitted as our modified fake_news.py), and the default two-layer one.

I'm denoting comments on text below with a #.

Note: For some of the larger RNNs, I made sure to submit those training jobs during low-use hours (e.g. 2-3 AM), so that they would be finished by morning.

PARAMETER CONFIGURATION:
-------------------------
1) batch size: I generally tried to increase this as much as I could while fitting it in memory. 2048 seemed to be a good rule of thumb for the word-based model, whereas I was able to get a batch size of 4096 to run on the character-based model.

2) epochs: I initially tested a variety of settings at only 20 epochs, and selected those models that performed best (see below) to run at 50/100 epochs.

3) train_len/valid_len: Increased train_len to 6 million for the default (business), had to decrease it to 5 million for the other article categories. Valid_len was kept constant at 5000.

4) bp_len: From reading into this, this appears to be the number of *layers* that backpropagation should iterate over. If that's the case, then a value of 30 is excessive/unnecessary for this type of RNN. Any attempts on my part to increase this figure (just for testing's sake) gave me CUDA OutOfMemoryErrors.

5) unit: From experimenting over both character-based output and word-based output, I found that the word-based output generally seemed to be more coherent, even with more (50) epochs. At 20 epochs, the character-based RNN would often insert punctuation at seemingly random places, and even with more epochs (50, 100), while it did generate words correctly, the words didn't have very much grammatical sense/flow, even when training this on a 4 layer network. Generally, the character-based RNN seems to perform worse than the word-based output.

The validation loss for the character-based RNN was lower, despite the results I got from the word-based RNN generaly making more sense.

6) n_units: I found the number of units per LSTM layer to be the biggest influence on the quality of the text, with more units/layer causing a corresponding increase in performance.

7) thresh: I didn't experiment with this too much, from what I recall I seem to have gotten a reasonably sized vocabulary for the word-based implementation. For the character-based implementation, it didn't really matter, since it was choosing from 80 characters.

PERPLEXITY:
--------------------
From discussing with some fellow students, as well as reading up on Tensorflow's documentation: Perplexity of a model appears to be e^(validation_loss)

With that in mind, our final trained examples had a perplexities between 77.48 & 107.77.

ON ADDING LAYERS:
--------------------
There's a running joke on the internet/in the data science community about statistical ML vs deep learning techniques, with something to the effect of:

"Statistical learning: Gentelmen, our learner overgeneralizes because we're using too high of a VC dimension. Get some people to minimize the structural risk, and rework our loss function to make this learner unbiased.

Deep learning: STACK MORE LAYERS"

The nod being to the fact that some neural networks seem to do better simply by increasing their size and/or number of layers. The 4 layer versions of networks I trained consistently had (slightly) lower validation loss for the same number of epochs trained, all other parameters held constant. Qualitatively, I don't think the four layer LSTM meaningfully improved the RNN's output.

Given that the performance didn't seem to improve all that much going from 2 layers to 4 layers, I opted to train with 2 layers for generating the Medicine/Technology/Entertainment articles, in the interest of saving time.

"both twitter and astrazeneca. allergan will pay over $15 billion in franchise in the big case if it goes public, following the legal difficulties to offer the combined company, it added, noting it has agreed to reduce its approach by making if the company gets  arthritis costs. allergan bought astrazeneca for  to $21 and $5.7 billion in annual earnings.

# I found it sort of interesting how more generally the RNN transitioned between topics as the generation of the article progressed, but the series of events in this particular RNN were relatively interesting. On writing on Star Wars, the RNN generated related semantic information about Disney, and in the process referenced alibaba, a media company Disney was recently working with to expand Disney's presence in China. From there, the RNN started writing about topics in the middle east, before writing about Jesus Christ, and apparently Game Of Thrones related material (iron bank, westeros).

MEDICINE:

he researchers say mers infection is transmitted through single contact with, people, or health care workers, of those who are infected, making their   to prevent the spread of the illness.  the current research has also shown that  get sick in the wild with up to 90 percent of those who are infected.  the deadly mers virus is now reduced than one person in the arabian peninsula. mers was first identified in humans, and children in china had no symptoms in , the first us case of the virus in the united states. the last known case was in the united states, and according to -, meanwhile,  people in the capital riyadh, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.  the disease is transmitted from person to person from person to person because there is no known cure for the virus.   fukuda said the man is not being isolated and put in a laboratory to use apparent symptoms of mild symptoms and had been infected with the virus.  anne , who heads the cdcs outbreak of mers, has been confirmed as the world health organization (who), but the cdc/, a global health official who was exposed to the virus hit the country last week. they identified the virus in the kingdom in december 2012.  the five cases and deaths were reported in the middle east, and dozens of people in saudi arabia had been infected with the deadly virus in saudi arabia and 's first major illness in a 19 percent near three weeks, the agency said.

# This is pretty good, given the syntactic complexity that usually surrounds discussing outbreaks. It correctly associated MERS with the arabian peninsula, given that MERS stands for Middle East Respiratory Symptom (a cousin of the SARS virus).


TECHNOLOGY:

for the three countries, sony now revealed a new version of the xbox one on wednesday during the announcement of all the more than 400 hours of download content  also  the xbox 360 for ps4 and sony xperia z2, which are 1 million popular xbox 360 consoles consoles, but well were selling a super smash bros. for  a ps4  in july.  the xbox one is also a huge gaming , and as april 8, the xbox one have the most talked that the xbox one is an attempt to try out secret australian marketing games.  last year, sony's console industry is due to offer more products that will be purchased due to the xbox 360 sold in september 2012.  meanwhile, sony has sold almost 13 million xbox ones worldwide until in 2014.  xbox one was purchased by a beta call and some of the links of the xbox 360 for the playstation 4 and xbox "first" was rumoured.  when the release of the xbox one, and in terms of  recognition, sony's playstation network and microsoft "playstation . the xbox 360 has over 1.1% million xbox one models like the consoles, unique them for all games than one of the biggest gaming games since this year.  microsoft has used an upgrade to xbox 360 since console will almost be available for  and - pcs for free and write off with titanfall.
 
# The RNN repeatedly references Sony (creator of the Playstation) as selling the XBox (made by Microsoft), as well as Super Smash Bros (a Nintendo Game). It is referencing them correctly, but at some point appears to have conflated their meanings. Nevertheless, this does look a fair amount like a market share report for videogame consoles.
